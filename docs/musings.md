A man with a hammer sees everything as a nail. I am a man and the hammer is backend. So rather than writing a frontend, I'll rather send HTML Responses to an API request. (I make hideous frontends).

Alright f it. I've spent too much time deciding exactly the right words to write here. Completely forgot that i named it musings. It's not supposed to be polished, it's not supposed to be grammatically correct, this isn't a portfolio project. this is just a one route api i wrote to hold my random thoughts in a black env in monospace font. Twitter's free tier has word limits that i hate. Medium, Substack, Blogger are all overkills. I just needed a text only platform to keep a history of my thoughts, rants and sometimes deep musings. So here we go. And not like i didn't think of adding features like search, pagination, filtering and what not. I didnt. partly bacause i am lazy, partly because i fear code, mostly because i make hedious frontends. Actually, above all, making it fancier will defeat its purpose. that is, making myself comfortable with making random shit for the sake of it. to save myself from becoming a linkedin slave who treats his github as a porrtfolio. I wanna treat it as a gallary of my scars. the portfolio will take care of itself. Let me keep it imperfect, because i literally made it to be so.
